Safari or Chrome.</p>\n<p>After flutter 3.7.0, as <a href=\"https://medium.com/flutter/whats-new-in-flutter-3-7-38cbea71133c\">the announcement</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Several <a href=\"https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?page=1&#x26;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+closed%3A2022-07-11..2022-11-30+label%3A%22f%3A+scrolling%22+reason%3Acompleted\">scrolling updates</a> have arrived with this release: polish and refinement for trackpad interactions, new widgets like Scrollbars and DraggableScrollableSheet, and improved handling for text selection within scrolling contexts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sure, the quality of scrolling improved in some aspects, but still feel \"not native\" / \"friction is too strong\" / \"laggy\" / \"jank\". In a word, Flutter Web does not scroll like a web.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://roszkowski.dev/2022/what-grinds-my-gears-in-flutter/\">Dominik Roszkowski said in his blog</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Flutter is emulating scrolling from scratch. This means it has to handle different scroll physics implementations per platform, various input devices, and things like scrollbar on its own.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/91788#issuecomment-944649235\">this answer</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We refer to this as \"scroll physics\" ... We are unlikely fix it entirely. It requires figuring out the right scroll physics per browser/platform, but we should be able to fix the most egregious situations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have the very same expectation as <a href=\"https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/91788#issuecomment-997512070\">this guy puts it</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Flutter, for sure is cool and nice - like it a lot, but scrolling kills all UX</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Weird Feeling of Scrolling of Flutter Web","date":"2023-02-07T02:00:00+00:00","description":"Compare with a native app or a traditional webpage, the scrolling behavior of a Flutter Web app is truly different.","featuredImageUrl":"https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Best-IDEs-Flutter-2022.png"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2023-02-28-practical-aws-cli-examples/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Practical AWS CLI Examples"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2022-12-12-weird-encoding-bug/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Weird Encoding Bug: Why \"€\" is displayed as \"â¬\" garbled characters?"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"337739fc-1457-57de-95a9-1387ec50f4bf","previousPostId":"43971360-944e-5840-859f-7a4d02db93cd","nextPostId":"49c5aeec-8222-55f0-bb02-8023842f2111"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1261413882","2660733687"]}
